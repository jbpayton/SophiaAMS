# Web Learn

Read a web page and permanently store its knowledge in semantic memory.
Like "studying" — slower but creates lasting knowledge with triple extraction.

## Usage

```run
exec(open("skills/web-learn/scripts/learn_from_url.py").read())
result = learn_from_url("https://example.com/article")
print(result)
```

## When to Use
- When you want to PERMANENTLY learn from a webpage
- When you want to remember content long-term
- For quick temporary reads, use the web-read skill instead
