# Bug Fixes - Multiple Issues Resolved

## Issues Fixed

### ‚úÖ 1. Message Duplication (Messages Appearing 3x)

**Problem:**
- Every message appeared 3 times in the chat
- The `useEffect` was processing ALL messages every time the `messages` array changed
- No tracking of which messages had already been processed

**Solution:**
- Added `processedMessageIds` ref to track which messages have been displayed
- Each message gets a unique ID based on type, index, and timestamp
- Messages are only added to chat if they haven't been processed before

**Code Changes:** `client/src/pages/ChatPage.jsx`
```javascript
const processedMessageIds = useRef(new Set())

useEffect(() => {
  messages.forEach((msg, index) => {
    const msgId = `${msg.type}-${index}-${msg.timestamp || Date.now()}`
    if (processedMessageIds.current.has(msgId)) {
      return // Skip already processed
    }
    processedMessageIds.current.add(msgId)
    // Process message...
  })
}, [messages])
```

### ‚úÖ 2. Can't Set Names

**Problem:**
- No way to customize user and assistant names
- Names were hardcoded as "You:" and "Assistant:"

**Solution:**
- Added settings panel with name configuration
- Settings button in header (gear icon)
- Names are stored in component state
- Names are passed to server and used in ingestion
- Display uses custom names

**Code Changes:**
- Added `userName` and `assistantName` state
- Added `showSettings` toggle
- Settings panel UI with input fields
- Names passed in chat message data
- Server uses names for ingestion

**Usage:**
1. Click ‚öôÔ∏è settings button in chat header
2. Edit "Your Name" and "Assistant Name"
3. Names update immediately in chat display
4. Names saved with conversations in memory

### ‚úÖ 3. Memory Context Not Being Used

**Problem:**
- Memory was being retrieved but not effectively used by LLM
- System prompt didn't clearly indicate memory context
- No logging to verify memory was included

**Solution:**
- Improved system prompt to explicitly tell LLM about memory context
- Added logging to track when memory context is included
- Better formatting of memory summary in prompt

**Code Changes:** `server/server.js`
```javascript
if (memoryContext && memoryContext.summary) {
  console.log(`[${sessionId}] Including memory context in LLM prompt`);
  llmMessages.push({
    role: 'system',
    content: `Here is context from your memory about this topic:\n\n${memoryContext.summary}\n\nUse this context naturally in your response when relevant.`
  });
} else {
  console.log(`[${sessionId}] No memory context available`);
}
```

**Verification:**
- Check server logs for: `[session-id] Including memory context in LLM prompt`
- Memory summary visible in chat UI
- LLM responses should reference previous context

### ‚úÖ 4. Document Upload Not Working

**Problem:**
- Document upload failed silently
- No error messages to diagnose issues
- Unclear what was happening

**Solution:**
- Added comprehensive logging on server
- Better error handling with detailed messages
- Client shows specific error messages
- Console logging for debugging

**Code Changes:**

**Server:** `server/server.js`
```javascript
app.post('/api/ingest/document', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    console.log('üìÑ Document upload request:', {
      source: req.body.source,
      textLength: req.body.text?.length
    });
    const response = await axios.post(`${PYTHON_API}/ingest/document`, req.body);
    console.log('‚úÖ Document uploaded successfully');
    res.json(response.data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('‚ùå Document upload failed:', error.message);
    res.status(500).json({
      error: error.message,
      details: error.response?.data
    });
  }
});
```

**Client:** `client/src/pages/AdminPage.jsx`
```javascript
if (res.ok) {
  alert('‚úÖ Document uploaded successfully!')
} else {
  const errorData = await res.json().catch(() => ({}))
  alert(`‚ùå Upload failed: ${errorData.error || 'Unknown error'}`)
}
```

**Debugging:**
- Check server console for upload logs
- Check browser console for errors
- Error messages show specific failure reason

---

## Additional Improvements

### Better Logging

Added comprehensive logging throughout:
- `[session-id] Chat message received from User: hello`
- `[session-id] Calling LLM...`
- `[session-id] LLM response received: Hello!...`
- `[session-id] Including memory context in LLM prompt`
- `[session-id] Ingesting conversation to memory...`
- `üìÑ Document upload request: {...}`

### Name Propagation

Names now flow through entire system:
```
Client Settings ‚Üí Chat Message ‚Üí Server ‚Üí Python API ‚Üí Memory Storage
```

### UI Improvements

**Settings Panel:**
- Clean, modern design
- Grid layout for name fields
- Instant updates
- Toggle with gear icon

**CSS Added:**
- `.settings-button` - Gear icon button
- `.settings-panel` - Settings container
- `.settings-form` - Form layout
- Input styling with focus states

## How to Test the Fixes

### 1. Test Message Deduplication
1. Send a chat message
2. Verify message appears ONCE only
3. Check server logs show single processing

### 2. Test Name Configuration
1. Click ‚öôÔ∏è settings button
2. Change "Your Name" to your name
3. Change "Assistant Name" to custom name
4. Send a message
5. Verify names appear in chat display
6. Check server logs show custom names

### 3. Test Memory Context
1. Have a conversation about a topic
2. Ask related follow-up questions
3. Verify memory is retrieved (see üß† icon)
4. Check server logs: `Including memory context`
5. LLM should reference previous context

### 4. Test Document Upload
1. Go to Admin page
2. Paste text in "Manual Text Input"
3. Enter source name (optional)
4. Click "Add Text to Memory"
5. Should see success message
6. Check server logs for upload confirmation
7. Stats should update

## Server Logs to Monitor

```
üöÄ Server running on http://localhost:3001
üêç Python API: http://localhost:8000
ü§ñ LLM: http://192.168.2.94:1234/v1 (openai/gpt-oss-20b)

üì± Client connected: abc123...
[abc123] Chat message received from Joey: hello
[abc123] Calling LLM...
[abc123] Including memory context in LLM prompt
[abc123] LLM response received: Hello Joey! How can I help...
[abc123] Ingesting conversation to memory...
[abc123] Conversation ingested: success

üìÑ Document upload request: { source: 'test', textLength: 150 }
‚úÖ Document uploaded successfully
```

## If You Still Have Issues

### Message Duplication

- Check for multiple tabs open

### Names Not Saving
- Verify settings panel appears when clicking ‚öôÔ∏è
- Check browser console for errors
- Names should appear immediately in display

### Memory Not Working
- Verify "Auto Memory Retrieval" is ON
- Check üß† icon appears showing retrieval
- Look for memory summary in expandable section
